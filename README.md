**Backstory**
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, international travel has been severely hampered by ever-changing restrictions and the fact that each country has its own set of travel and quarantine procedures. With the increased availability of COVID-19 vaccines, numerous countries have begun to take steps to restore international travel. These preliminary steps include enabling vaccinated people to skip the quarantine period. These countries have created their own apps that allow travellers to upload their COVID testing results as well as evidence of immunisation before flying. Canada's launch of the ArriveCAN app is an example of this. The problem is that each country has established its own platform, which causes confusion and inconvenience for frequent travellers. with a Vaccine Passport app, users will be able to upload their COVID test results as well as vaccination evidence to a universal platform that will be trusted on a global scale. This will not only reduce time and provide comfort for the passenger, but it will also allow each traveller to see the entry requirements for their destinations. The requirements will be in accordance with the destination site's local laws and government regulations, such as who is permitted entry, pre-flight testing times, vaccination needs, and quarantine standards.
